# notebooks
Machine learning and statistical algorithms implemented in pure NumPy and well-known libraries such as Sklearn, Pytorch, and Statsmodels.

## Linear Regression
1. [Implementation](/notebooks/blob/main/linear-regression/theory.ipynb) from scratch.

## Graph Neural Networks
1. [Implementation](/notebooks/blob/main/gnns/rgcn.ipynb) from scratch of Relational Graph Convolutional (R-GCN) layer.
2. [Implementation](/notebooks/blob/main/gnns/gat.ipynb) with NumPy and DGL of the Graph Attention (GAT) layer.
